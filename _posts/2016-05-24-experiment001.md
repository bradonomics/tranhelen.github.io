## Description
__Programs:__ AE & Photoshop  
__Time spent:__ Five hours  
__Working files:__ [Dribbble](https://drb.li/FSnWi)

Inspiration for this type of menu I attribute to a video game series I adored growing up. They were the best at menus.

## Takeaways
* This solution requires specific animations for every line depending on which link is chosen.
* Gifs are really bad at displaying gradients. If I have any complex animations, I will have to adjust the background to suit.
* There appears to be a discrepancy between the way AE & Photoshop display type even when the Character + Paragraph styles are identical. Adjusted this to only do type in AE if it's associated to any animations. Wasted time on this.
* Had to rebuild the animated icon + drop-down menu in AE as well. Wondering now if it makes sense to build the entire thing in AE.
* Slow animations may be annoying when opening + closing menus. Sped this particular animation up a lot in order to avoid fatique. 
* With the cursor animation I made + some icons this process will most likely be faster.
