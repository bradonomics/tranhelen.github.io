High-growth companies are not for those who love stability. Those caught in the growth spurt rarely have time to reflect and I have been victim to this hurried state as well. I don’t think I take enough note of what’s going on.

It's been a short period of time and the company has added an additional zero to the employee count since I've joined. With this, I've had to start a Design practice within a larger one and keep it stable whilst the company continued to grow around us.

Since the beginning of all this, these things have remained constant:

1. **Routines can help with instability.** Implementing regular touch-points within the team helped maintain the semblance of stability. It's also great as a feedback loop, ensuring accountability which can be forgotten when projects become overwhelming.
2. **Culture is more important than people realize.** The immeasurable things: random coffees, hallway conversations, and Slack gifs keep a team together and help foster trust and better communication... but it's a long play and frequently disregarded. It’s management’s job to keep culture a priority, even if the IC’s don’t consider it “_work_” or "important." It's more important than most people realize.
3. **Process is ever-evolving.** In a more stable business environment, you can likely find a couple of tools or processes which work for the majority of situations and repeat when required. Our management processes have to change every few months and we have to stay adaptive.
4. **People respond differently.** High-growth brings out parts of certain people which they would rather keep closeted. Compassion must be practiced frequently and benefit of the doubt must be given more often.

There must be more to grasp from this experience but lately I've only had enough time to breathe in-between meetings.
