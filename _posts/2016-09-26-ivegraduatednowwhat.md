*I did a talk at <a href="https://bitmaker.co/">Bitmaker</a> in Toronto a few weeks ago to aspiring Designers about what to do when starting out. I receive a lot of the same type of questions through Twitter and e-mail so I thought I'd expand on the topic. This is part one of three.*

There are three things any particular junior should be concerned about: getting better at their craft, preparing to get into the job market, and understanding the environment once you have a position.

## Getting Better

Graduating from formal education, a bootcamp, or even apprenticeship based programs puts you in the same position as others who graduate with the same skillset. While there is enough demand in some markets, there are not enough positions that can support the mentorship of a Junior Designer. Even if you manage to find one, you may find yourself in a less than desirable place in terms of growth.

All Designers must adopt a growth mindset from graduation, and hopefully, much before that. You've joined an industry in which learning new skillsets is a constant and it's not unusual to be required to learn fast. This will be the case for the rest of your career.

Passion is not followed or found, but it is cultivated. To ensure longevity in your career, you must find satisfaction in learning things, or, deliberate practice.** If you manage to fine-tune this skill of yours, you'll find that competition will melt away fairly quickly. One of my favourite books which I frequently quote says this about it,

>> The good news about deliberate practice is that it will pusuh you past this plateau and into a realm where you have little competition.
>> – Cal Newport, "So Good They Can't Ignore You"

### The Basics

These are the things I firmly believe any Junior Designer will get a lot of value out of.

- A List Apart, a Book Apart, and anything produced by the teams associated with this group. The reason why I frequently recommend them is because their content has been steadily useful for years. It's always relevant, well researched, and well worth your time.

- The following Design books, if you're interested in getting better at visual work, these are the books that have followed me outside of college:
- Geometry of Design - Kimberly Elem
- Detail in Typography - Jost Hochuli
- A Type Primer - John Kane
- The ELements of Typography Style - robert Bringhurst

- Design is a cultured and creative job. Creativity is about connecting dots, but you cannot do that if you have no dots to connect. You *have to* invest time in reesarching new ideas in different industries. Take interest in furthering your interest in Design as an industry and just not what you see on your computer.

Find a mentor. Mentors do not have to be a formal relationship. I have mentors which have guided my career and they haven't met me yet. Thankfully, there are is a very strong Design community on Twitter which you can follow and learn from. Surround yourself with people you admire.

### Self-initiating

While you search for a job, realize that your portfolio is *never done.* You will always be constnatly building your portfolio and you cannot afford to wait for a position in order to get better. Hrere are things you can do, by your lonesome:

- Attend meet-ups to find like-minded folk (but not just Design meet-ups... finding a developer is easier at a dev meet-up than it is at a Dribbble meet-up). Listings are available on <a href="">meet-up.com</a>, announced on <a href="">Designer News</a>, or talked about on the Twitterverse.
- Attend hack-a-thons to open up the possibility of working with a motivated team. There are tons of hack-a-thon listings online, or again, find them on the Twitterverse.
- Design a product and then hide someone to bring your Design to life. While this option isn't available for those who do not have the resources, it can be a route for those who do. You can hire team members on <a href="">upwork.com</a> or <a href="">elance.com</a>.
- Build it yourself. This will take the longest and is probably out of the question for those who are juggling real-life problems, it may be possible for some of you who love to develop. You can check out <a href="">codeschool</a>, <a href="">team teamhouse</a>, and <a href="">udemy</a> for great places to start.

### Specializations

You may get to a point in which you feel like you have the basics down (unlikely, but let's say you're especially confident). In that case, it may make soem sense to pick a specialization to focus on.

There are many topics Designers can become specialists in and I detail them in a previous post of mine. You can pick anything really, learn everything you can about it and use your blog to track what you're learning.** 

## Tracking Progress

In my opinion, speed is an excellent barometer for a Junior Designers. Production skills are the foundation for the rest of your career and your ability to get your timing under control as well as your ability to correctly guess how long it'll take you to do something will serve you for the rest of your career.

For the first little bit of your career, time-tracking your projects, even when you're not billling anyone hourly, is a good way to understand how long you take to solve a problem. An alternative thing to try is timeboxing problem solving. For example, I redesign my website every so often, but I never give myself more than two weeks from start to infish of the project. If you give yourself too much time, you will take it and procrastinate making decisions because you have all the time in the world. In the real world, you don't.

I don't mean to say that you shoulud be solving things at lightning speed with no quality, but as you become more comfortable witht he software you're using, you should become faster at the repetitive tasks. This gives you a fair amoutn of space to invest the rest of your time in better research or developing critical thinking skills. A not-so-great position to be in is to be able to come up with an idea but be unable to produce it in a time that makes you valuable to the rest of your team. 

You can definitely define success or getting better another way, but I personally find that speed and foundational production skills are a great focus for the first couple of years. 

## What next?

Tune in over the next two weeks and I'll go over getting a job and what to do once you land your first position.
