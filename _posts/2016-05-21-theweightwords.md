title: The Weight of Words
---
Words have always guided my interests. The majority of time is spent seeking personal essays in video, audio or written format, following the careers of stand-up comedians and writers, and furrowing my eyebrows in meetings furiously intent on understanding what's *behind* the words. I have never been more aware of the weight of words than I am now. They are becoming heavier.

The writer judges themselves by their intentions but ultimately the power is held by the reader, who interprets. As communication becomes more impersonal and we work in larger teams over larger distances, the benefit of the doubt gets lost amongst the noise and all we have left are emojis to communicate how we *truly* feel.

Being more articulate is a necessity of management, I'm learning, as communication *is* my job. Spending a year reading more books has been the largest contribution I have ever made to my own growth. Listening to others with more experience in management has been another. Communication has historically not been my strongest skill-set. I do not have a choice in these matters now so I must come around to it.

Three things of note:

* *Perception matters.* Team morale is one of the biggest indicators of a project's success. The emotions of your team are in your court. Priming a brain has immense impacts on actions and everyone is primed by everything they see in the course of a day. Be supportive. Be confident. Do not focus too much on the negative. Keep calm. 
* *Be brief.* Superfluous words must be eliminated. Everyone has the same amount of time, but everyone also has less time than you. Stay focused, answer the question(s), address the concerns succinctly and then stop talking. When in doubt, consider saying nothing.
* *Don't publish immediately.* If you are in a position in which your words weigh more than others, do not hit 'Send' without pausing. What is your goal? Are your words going to get you there? Does this hit a sore spot with anyone? Are you being neglectful? Are you answering the 5 W's? If someone read this without context, would they give you the benefit of the doubt?

The strongest leaders are great communicators. Consider your words and be mindful.
