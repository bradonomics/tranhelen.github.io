Every time you start, it gets easier to start. Every time you stop, it gets easier to stop.

When people look at learning a new skill, often the most difficult stage to get over is starting and then continuing the momentum. Momemtum begets momemtum. Some people use the word *passion* to explain this, but *passion* is actually the wrong word. It's discipline you're looking for.

I started writing every day for at least one hour about two months ago. The majority of what I write never gets published. That doesn't matter. That's not the point. There is no expert on earth who hasn't put in the work.

There are going to be days when I hate writing, like todayâ€“I cannot think of anything else but the recent election. I'm going to write anyway, even if it's not the most insightful thing I can offer. This applies to everything; the gym, work, and other hobbies. Even on my worst days, I go anyway.

When people look at my streaks they ask me, "What's the secret?" There is no secret. You just show up.
