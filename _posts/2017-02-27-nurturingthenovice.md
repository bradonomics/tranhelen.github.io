A novice's output is really special. Not only are they creating during a time of little pressure, they output an extraordinary amount of energy that others rarely match. When nurtured with frequent and positive feedback loops, they can be great contributors to creative fulfillment.

I am noticing that after long projects, my interest in my work dips ever-so-slightly and I get _the itch_. Maybe I have to change projects. Maybe I have to change teams. Maybe I have to change _companies_. Out With The Old.

It's difficult to nurture my creative side in a corporate setting. I didn't grow up wishing to work for a corporation... it wasn't even on my radar. I have gone through multiple periods of discontent when I didn't feel like I was as _creatively_ fulfilled as I _should_ be, whatever that meant.

My day-to-day gets further and further away from my creative roots as a manager and I can feel the dust accumulating. To counter-balance this, I've been setting aside time to nurture the novice within. Writing was one avenue for me, but I also pick at a ukulele, flirt with bodybuilding as a hobby, and read books I don't entirely understand.

Careers put you in a specific mindset. They become monsters you have to feed and if you don't feed them, they will die. Being a novice reminds me these pressures mostly come from within. One step every day keeps the dust from settling.
