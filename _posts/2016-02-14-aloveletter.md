Almost exactly a year ago Louis C.K. sent a letter to his fans detailing his career in stand-up. He talked about what it was like when he was growing up and the comedy clubs which defined and guided his career. It was a love letter.

I have received a lot of attention for the previous layout I had.<a id="anchor-1" href="#note-1" class="fieldnotes-anchor">[1]</a> I wasn't expecting it at all and was surprised when it launched to the amount of attention it received. As the months passed, I began to really resent it. I've been thinking a lot about my career building on the internet and how privileged I feel to have been able to witness it grow and how much this website didn't reflect that at all. Where were my roots?

The internet that I knew and fell in love with so many years ago wasn't adorned. It was simple and it came without pretense. My favourite websites were just piles and piles of text, usually on a black background, and over the years I got to know the authors very intimately. I don't get that feeling as much anymore but I look back nostalgically on the <i>good ol' days</i> and am really glad that they were the foundation of my career.

I've been writing a lot more lately and I've been finding that I'm not as open to publishing my work as I once was. The latest trends in design imply a level of heroicism that my writing does not deserve nor want. And I had let my design influence the purpose of this website.

So, I've toned it down. It seemed like the only thing to do.
