		<p>At the beginning of 2014, Shopify released my theme <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/themes/lookbook/styles/classic">Lookbook</a>. It was my first theme for Shopify and it has gone on to become fairly successful. While the theme looks simple, the creation of Lookbook was anything but.</p>

		<h2>The Concept</h2>

		<p>When we started the project, another Designer and I tackled two separate verticals. While <a href="http://twitter.com/supervee">@supervee</a> started building what would end up being <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/themes/supply/styles/blue">Supply</a>, I worked on my new potential theme for the fashion industry. Fashion is an industry I have dabbled in and out of so I was interested to see if I could apply any of my past experience to the theme.</p>

		<p>For a brief time, I was a hobbyist dabbling as a fashion and fine art photographer. While I didn't intend to make a career change, I got far enough to see the inner workings of the new model and fashion world.</p>

		<p>Lookbooks are portfolios which models, designers, make-up artists and agents use. Models, via their agents, are booked through their books, make-up artists are judged by their beauty shots, and the fashion designers they all work for look at hundreds of books in a year. Excellent photography is the make-or-break for anyone working in fashion.</p>

		<p>So, when I was initially conceptualizing my theme, I was inspired by my past experiences and knew that I wanted to play on the common thread between fashion and commerce: photography. After spending some time researching popular fashion houses, low-end retailers and everyone in-between, I had formed the initial concept in my mind of a lookbook inspired theme.</p>

		<h2>The Cold Hard Decisions</h2>

		<p>The product direction was guided by three constraints informed by my research. In a project like this, with no constraints, you have to be willing to lay some down for yourself. The harder the constraints, the more opinionated your design will be. A theme is a great place for a Designer to make riskier decisions as a healthy theme ecosystem (of which Shopify has) ensures that everyone can get something that they need.</p>

		<p>My three constraints:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>The theme had to be focused on the imagery that drives the industry.</li>
			<li>The theme had to put the brand and products first without being too complex.</li>
			<li>The theme had to be an alternative to a full grid-based storefront.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>When refining my wireframes, I decided to utilize full-screen imagery of the products and lay them horizontally beside each other as if they were in a printed portfolio. This meant that there was no typical "front-page" meaning that a storeowner would never have to fill their store with extra marketing imagery and their products would always be first priority.</p>

		<p>Lookbook was different, definitely, and I had a hard time selling the idea.</p>

		<h2>Development Limbo</h2>

		<p>What I thought was going to be a simple theme turned out to be a huge undertaking. While the design looked simple, building it was anything but. Shopify's theme documentation wasn't where it is now, Timber didn't exist and I had no prior knowledge of Shopify's theming system. All this made for a pretty steep learning curve with the ever-looming fear of failure looking over my shoulder.</p>

		<p>Sure, it probably wasn't that dramatic, but it really felt that way sometimes. Lookbook wasn't like any other Shopify theme so it had it's own set of unique problems. Problems with responsive design, touch-screen responsiveness and browser/device compatibility were numerous because of it's complex build.</p>

		<p>Thankfully, I had the help of <a href="http://twitter.com/cshold">@cshold</a>, the Themes team and the Themes Guru team to pull me through the darkness. Over the next few months, Lookbook was refined and picked apart until we had a theme we were satisfied with.</p>

<h2>Launch and the Future of Lookbook</h2>

		<p>Releasing Lookbook was nerve-wrecking. It was the first theme I had built with such a large audience and with such a strange concept. There was no guarantee that it was going to do well. For the first couple of days, I left our reporting tabs open to check out all the storesowners who had installed Lookbook.</p>

		<p>Thankfully, the theme was generally well-received. I'm also happy to say that, so far, it's installed on 2000+ shops and is the fifth-highest converting free theme for Shopify. Personally, Lookbook was a great project for me, inspired the creation of <a href="/2014/11/13/timber.html">Timber</a> and paved the way for my second theme, <a href="https://themes.shopify.com/themes/pop/styles/classic">Pop</a>.</p>
