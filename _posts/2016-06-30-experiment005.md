I spent an untold amount of time trying to recreate a cursor animation I saw that blew my mind. I didn't entirely nail it but I can live with what I did. Pegging to expand this animation a little bit more next time, I had more grandiose plans that didn't quite pan out. I had to publish and move on.

* I really need to create a library of cursors so I can stop the madness.
* Photoshop fucked me again. Originally the background was patterned, and I thought there weren't that many colours but apparently it was *one* too many. I'm not sure how to survive in this gif world.
