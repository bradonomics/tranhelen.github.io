        <p><a href="http://helentran.com/46books">Last year</a> I re-ignited my love for reading. This time around, I'm highlighting the books that have <em>changed my perspective</em> and some <em>honourable mentions</em>. The rest I've listed for completion sake but I'm not particularly tied to them for any reason.</p>

                <p><b>Crucial Conversations by Collective</b>
                <br>This is a great book for any Designer who is looking for a way to adjust their communication for better results. I found it helpful to reframe some of my hard conversations. Considering re-reading this to ensure my application is engrained.</p>

                <p><b>Consider the Lobster by David Foster Wallace</b>
                <br>Another collection of essays by DFW, a couple of which changed the way I look at the presidential campaign in 2016 prior to the election results, the English dictionary wars, <em>white male standard English</em>, and autobiographies written by stars.</p>

                <p><b>But What If We're Wrong? by Chuck Klosterman</b>
                <br>If gravity, something the author believes to be true to the deepest levels of his being, is <em>incorrect</em>, what does that mean?</p>
                <p>This book meandered a bit but the overall argument was interesting. I'm now dedicating more time to proving myself wrong. Although light-hearted, it changed the way I think.</p>

                <br>After the election, I went searching for answers. This explains the history of the Democratic party and I felt the results to be more sensical than not in the end.</p>
                <p>I'll be exploring more political books over the next year to develop my understanding better.</p>
