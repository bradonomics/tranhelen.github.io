We're going to talk about money.

Here are some numbers: A business charges $2500/student. There are 25 students per cohort every three months for 12 classes. Instructors are offered $25-$45/hr. They take home about 1% - 4% of the revenue from each cohort.

In conversation with someone in which I was incredibly upset with the split between instructor and business, as instructors would be paid more in the freelance market, they told me that they would, "do it anyway because I love it and it's not about the money."

*Goddamn*, I thought, *When did this become so perverted?*

One of the most displeasing sentiments out there is that if you are passionate about something, the money shouldn't matter. People will fall all over themselves agreeing to this. Why not? It sounds so good. If anyone admits that they do care about money, then that must mean they're not passionate or their intentions aren't altruistic.

No.

I like (and occasionally love) my day-to-day work and still get very excited when projects are launched. This feeling keeps me going through the long nights before launch and keeps me motivated to stay relevant in the industry in my sparetime. This time, especially the invested sparetime, is indisputedly why I produce the results I do.

Mediocre work is done by someone who doesn't care. This is not a reflection of them as people, they may simply not have the same values the company/client is looking for. There are tons of people out there who do not care. You can point to any stranger on the street, hire them, and odds are very high they will not care. If companies were staffed like this, no one would ever complain about lack of 'qualified' candidates. Bodies are bodies.

If you love something, you will typically have a drive to do it better. This is what people call passion, and this is <em>exactly</em> why people should pay you more.

I have always looked at money like a patronage. If your client or employer value your work, they must value whatever makes your work excellent. What makes your work so good is a combination of experiences, your life choices and your mental state. So, to support the quality of your work, they must pay you enough for you to experience more, continue to make better choices, and stay mentally stable.

Ask for more **because** you love it.
