## Description
__Programs:__ AE & Photoshop  
__Time spent:__ Six hours  
__Working files:__ [Download on Dribbble](https://drb.li/UlqkQ)

This is an app I really wish existed... I'm getting into more hiking as a hobby and I'm currently using Instagram as an informal journal of where I've been. Something more dedicated to hikers who love to write or take photographs would  be much appreciated. 

## Takeaways
* Gif exports annihilate colour. To reduce the impact when using a full-colour image, shave off as many seconds as possible and then export with more colours. It's never perfect, but it's better.
* I got further with different easing curves. Cohesively it feels a little bit odd and I tried to solve that by pushing the various components together and staggering the animations.
* I initially tried to be clever and create a different icon for community and then had a very good laugh when I zoomed out and they were deeply creepy. *Can I still call myself a Graphic Designer?*
