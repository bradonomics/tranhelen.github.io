One of the [books I read last year](http://helentran.com/46-books-later) was a commencement speech book. I'll admit I love commencement speeches so you can smirk and we can both move forward. I like them because I never heard mine. I didn't go to my graduation and it will always be a small regret that I didn't stand next to my classmates and listen to someone give me advice that I wouldn't listen to.

Maybe they said something funny and I would have laughed uproariously and then forgotten about it the next day. Or maybe they would have shared a regret of theirs and I would be forced to wrestle with the life choices I made as well. Or maybe they would have said something so wise I wouldn't have been able to see the wisdom until much later in my life, standing in line at the grocery store buying gummy bears.

In any case, a piece from Debbie Millman's speech stood out to me,

<blockquote class="large">
	<p>If you imagine less, less will be what you undoubtedly deserve. Do what you love, and don't stop until you get what you love. Work as hard as you can, imagine immensities, don't compromise and don't waste time. Start now.</p>
</blockquote>

I was so enamoured. I immediately took to my chalkboard wall and wrote those sentences out so I could read them every morning. And I did that, I read them every morning. I was delighted to end 2015 with a level of gratefulness and joy that I hadn't felt before in my entire life. Maybe there's something to yearly themes after all.

I now have something new on my wall, found by way of a favourite comedian,

<blockquote class="large">
	<p>If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And when I am for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?</p>
</blockquote>

Ah yes, I'm one of *those* people now.
