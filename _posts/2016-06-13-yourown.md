There are days when going to work isn't an appealing option. This is not a comment on Shopify; most days I generally enjoy coming into the office and look forward to Mondays (TGIM). There are not many people who can say that and I'm grateful for the opportunity that I've been given. There's just something else that's been gnawing away at me.

Lately I've been seeing through the launch of a project I've been working on for longer than I'm happy to admit, scaling the Product Design team in Toronto, learning the intricacies of management and understanding how to make use of my strengths and weaknesses. Day-to-day, it's pretty okay and sometimes fun. Some days, it's just not okay. I like to imagine that at the rip old age of 27 I can control my impulses a little better and this is more or less correct yet I still occasionally let the mundanity of life get to me and my brain implodesâ€“inward.

I have been working for a really long time. I took my first job when I was thirteen and I've been more or less employed since then. The one job that stands out to me still, and will probably stand out to me forever was my first business. There's nothing comparable to your own. It's yours. You take responsibility for it, you nurture it, and it's failure and success is on you.

There's a year of my life where I don't have strong memories of friendships or events unless they were all related to my business. The year went by quickly and even though I clocked in eleven hour days seven days a week between my full-time job and my full-time business, it never really bothered me. When my Dad told me I looked tired over Christmas dinner it came as a surprise to me. I didn't feel *tired*; I felt *invigorated*.

Closing my business was the right choice for me at the time. There are days though, like today, and I miss it. There's nothing like your own.
