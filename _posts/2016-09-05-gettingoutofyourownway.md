Self-improvement is a laudable goal. It's as inseparable from tech culture as efficiency hacking or Soylent (these may be two sides of the same coin). I've been caught up in the same fervour and have become obsessed with it. Except, I have gone the wrong way and it has been impacting me negatively.

I've always been a sensitive overthinker. This piece of me, combined with a high bar I've set for myself, occasionally becomes a bit of a self-criticizing nightmare if I let thoughts linger on too long.

Here is the extrapolated list of things I have been accused of over the years: being too opinionated, being too quiet, being too aggressive, not speaking up, speaking too fast, being intimidating, too negative, being unapproachable, being warm, being snobby, being open, sitting angrily, and being a show-off. And, without critical thought, I tried to problem solve for all of these. Solving problems is what I do for a living, so why not turn it inwards?

It reached a peak for me earlier last month. I was frustrated by all the comments by my personality. None of them had highlighted any issues with my continued and eventual output. I felt unwanted and increasingly isolated and it had started to affect my output, my physicality, and my personal life. 

My hike in Sweden was a welcome change. It was 100km, if I so chose, to think about what was happening around me. It didn't happen the way I envisioned, as per usual with my solo trips. Instead, I listened to a couple of books written by a journalist I adore, caught up on some podcasts, and occasionally walked hours of the trail without any entertainment except the muffled steps of each of my feet being placed one ahead of the other.

As I arrived at each cabin, familiar faces who I passed by or who passed by me greeted me warmly. We sat together in the common areas after our hikes, ate dinner, talked about our lives, and played card games. In the morning, we parted ways and continued onwards with our trips, never knowing for sure if we'd see each other again. 

On the last leg, I had dragged my cranky self (I had spent the last few hours navigating muggy bogs) up my last mountain slope. Putting on my rectangle grin, I wandered around the last cabin enjoying the basic of human comforts: a shower and a cold-*ish* beer. I turned on my phone for the first time and received an avalanche of e-mails and text messages from my friends. After an hour I turned it off again.

As I sat, I watched as hikers trickled into the cabin. Some of them nodded towards me as they walked by and some stopped to have a quick chat. I was shortly after adopted by a group of seven women, who told me they admired by gumption to hike the trail myself, who then shepherded me to dinner and introduced me to another couple of families. I spent the rest of the evening enjoying the company of another group of hikers who had accepted me. Completely unfettered by the delusion of self-improvement, I felt more present and relaxed than I had in a very long time. 

The person who *I* identify with was reaffirmed by my trip. No one thought I was *too* anything and they're still talking to me now. I've let subjective opinions about my personality get in the way of myself and what I'm interested in seeing in my life. No one has the right to decide how you should be.

Alan Watts has a good talk [about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4jBd4fArfQ). He notes that we punish ourselves when we don't achieve whatever goal we set. We're so obsessed with self-improvement... we believe that we can reach a status of *better*. He points out that if we knew what that even meant, we'd just be that. He ends his talk by challenging us, "Watch what happens. [...] When you do that, you give yourself a chance."
