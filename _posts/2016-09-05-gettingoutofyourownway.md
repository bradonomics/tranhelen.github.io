Self-improvement is a laudable goal. It's as inseparable from tech culture as efficiency hacking or Soylent (these may be two sides of the same coin). I've been caught up in the same fervour and I become obsessed with it. Except, I went the wrong way, and it has been impacting me negatively.

I've always been a sensitive overthinker. This piece of me, combined with a high bar I've set for myself, occasionally becomes a bit of a self-criticizing nightmare if I let thoughts linger on too long.

Here is the extrapolated list of things I have been accused of over the years: being too opinionated, being too quiet, being too aggressive, not speaking up, speaking too fast, being intimidating, too negative, being unapproachable, being warm, being snobby, being open, sitting angrily, and being a show-off. And, without critical thought, I tried to problem solve for all of these. Solving problems what I do for a living, so why not turn it onto myself?

It reached a peak for me earlier last month. I was frustrated by all the comments by my personality. None of them had highlighted any issues with my continued and eventual output. I felt unwanted and increasingly isolated (although, if I'm honest, this hasn't completely gone away.) And that's when it started to affect my output, my physicality, and my personal life. 

I was pleased to start my hike in Sweden. It was 100ish km, if I so chose, to think about what was happening around me. It didn't happen the way I envisioned, as per usual with my solo trips. Instead, I listened to a couple of books from a journalist I loved, caught up on some podcasts, and occasionally walked hours of the trail without any entertainment but the muffled steps of each of my feet being placed one ahead of the other.

As I arrived at each cabin, familiar faces who I passed by or who passed by me greeted me warmly. We sat together in the common areas after our hikes, ate dinner, talked about our lives, and played card games. In the morning, we parted ways and continued onwards with our trips, never really knowing if we'd see each other again. 

On the last leg, I had dragged my cranky self (I had spent the last few hours navigating muggy bogs) up my last mountain slope. Putting on my rectangle grin, I wandered around the last cabin enjoying the basic of human comforts: a shower and a cold-*ish* beer. I turned on my phone for the first time and received an avalanche of e-mails and text messages from my friends. After an hour I turned it off again.

I watched as the hikers I had become familiar with trickle into the cabin. Some of them nodding to me as they walked by, some of them stopping to have a short conversation about the trail. Adopted by a group of seven women, who told me they admired by gumption to hike the trail myself, I was shepherded to dinner and introduced to another couple of families, who also accepted me with open arms, and this led me to spend the night talking with a group of hikers. Completely unfettered by the cloud of self-improvement, I felt more present and relaxed than I had in a very long time. 

I'm back, and I'm feeling like me again. The person who *I* identify with was reaffirmed by my trip. No one thought I was *too* anything and they're still talking to me now. I let subjective opinions about my personality get in the way of myself. No one has the right to decide how you should be, and they are  biased by their insecurities and judgements. 

Alan Watts has a [good talk about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4jBd4fArfQ). He notes that we punish ourselves when we don't achieve whatever goal we set. We're so obsessed with self-improvement... we believe that we can reach a status of *better*. He points out that if we knew what that even meant, we'd just be that. He challenges us, "Watch what happens. [...] When you do that, you give yourself a chance." 

> Your own nature will begin to take care of itself... because you're not getting in the way of yourself all the time. You will begin to find out, that the great things you do are really happening.
