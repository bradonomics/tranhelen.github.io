Asking for solutions first is bad management advice. _‘Don’t bring me problems—bring me solutions!'_ teaches your team that it’s okay not to speak up if they cannot solve it themselves. That’s not how to work as a team and it certainly doesn't leverage the collective intelligence of the people you hired.

Encouraging your team to talk about the problems in a non-judgemental environment is key to building trust. According to Google’s Aristotle project, in which they studied 180 teams<a id="anchor-1" href="#note-1" class="fieldnotes-anchor">[1]</a> over the course of a year looking for patterns,

<blockquote class="large">
    <p>…Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.</p>
</blockquote>

It’s healthy to complain and be angry. Emotions are a great indicator of something not working so well, or, even the opposite-lack of emotion. They can also be a great predictor of something _about_ to go wrong.

In February, our leadership team<a id="anchor-2" href="#note-2" class="fieldnotes-anchor">[2]</a> identified the need for us to run a retrospective. Our team has grown in size 400% within a year and when you have that many new hires maintaining a strong working culture can be difficult.

Ensuring that we’re always aware of what impacts a Designer’s output is our top priority. While we do 1:1s, group chats, and eat lunch with our team, sometimes it simply isn’t enough.

## Running a Retrospective

### What is it?

A retrospective is an exercise designed to help a team identify opportunities for growth or celebrate wins. They can be complex but I like to use a fairly simple model for the sake of simpler logistics.

You can run one after a project launches (to focus on process), amongst a discipline team (to focus on team process), or anytime you feel like there are things to discuss (this is the stage we were in.) It’s a great time to _pause_ and reflect on things we forget about when we get lost in everyday work.

The goals of a retrospective:

- To celebrate and identify what the team is doing well
- To bring problems up to your colleagues
- To discuss things in an honest and transparent way
- To encourage newer team members to participate honestly by setting an example

### Preparing for it

Finding the time to run an exercise like this with everyone in the room _is_ a bit difficult. We are cognizant of the amount of time this takes away from this many people so the leadership team narrowed down our target areas to six. There are many more spectrums that affect a team but we had to start somewhere:

- **Product** - What are you thinking about what we launch everyday? Are we proud of what we ship? How are the processes we use doing? Are we missing anything?
- **Culture** - Are you supported at work? Are the activities that you do on a weekly basis sufficient and/or meet the goals of the exercise? Do you think the Design team works collaboratively with each other?
- **Growth**  - Are you placed on the right projects for your growth? How do you feel as the company is scaling? Are you able to do your best in the position you’re in? Have you made progress in the past six months?
- **Communication**  - What is it like working within your project team, within the Toronto office, or with the company? Do you get the information you need in order to do your job? Is your position clear to you?
- **Leadership**  - Do you feel like you’re well-represented by the leadership team? Does the team feel transparent and do you understand why decisions are being made around the office? Do you feel your self-assessments are fair? Do you think the leadership team cares about you?

This list was sent out _before_ the retrospective to give our Designers some time to think about it beforehand.

### The exercise

Before the team arrived into the room, we wrote the theme down on a post-it note and cordoned off walls for each theme. We split each wall into two sides labelling one "happy" and one "sad" and everyone wrote down what is working and what isn't.

</figure>

They were encouraged to put up their stickies as soon as they wrote it and to walk around and read them as other team members put theirs up. If they agreed with anything, they could simply write a “+1” sticky note and add it beside the original. We gave ourselves 30 minutes to run the first part of the exercise.

As the Designers brainstormed, the leadership team would read through every theme and group like post-it notes together if it felt like the notes were related. This is to help guide the discussions afterwards and understand the urgency of the problem identified.

Afterwards, the team gathered around each theme and read every post-it note. We asked questions for clarification if needed and encouraged each other to give examples if they were comfortable doing so. If we could clarify it further, we rewrote a post-it note if the original wasn't clear to the team.

The leadership team documented the post-it notes and spent some time distilling it into a document where we ranked the most pressing issues (the ones with the most amount of notes) within a theme. We posted the doc to the team on Slack and asked for additional examples if they wanted to add any.

## What happens after a Retrospective?

### Coming up with ideas

Certainly, there are things that you can do as a lead to address part of what your team has identified but you may not always know the right answer… and you aren’t always the right person to execute, either.

We planned an all-day offsite after:

- To encourage team members to be more engaged with the solutions of the problems identified
- To use our collective brain-power to come up with better solutions than perhaps the leadership team can
- To give our Designers an opportunity to practice their leadership skills and apply Design Thinking to organizational or team process change

Before we started, we reviewed everything again as a group and volun-told a Designer to facilitate conversations about each theme. The rest of the team split themselves up based on which theme they were most passionate about and we gave ourselves an hour or so to work through the initial thoughts.

Then we took a break and ate pizza and drank optional mimosas for a bit.

After lunch, the teams were tasked with brainstorming possible solutions for how to fix the problems identified on the team and/or continue doing better on the things we were already getting right. The goal was to come up with not only a solution but an implementation plan answering, what? how? and who?

At the end of the day, the team presented and discussed the solutions they came up with. We used this time to ask each other unanswerable questions and think about the blockers that could come up during implementation.

### Execution

Ideas mean nothing unless executed well so we had to follow up on our retrospective and offsite. We used our next Product Round-table (our weekly sync with our Product Designers) to break out into groups and turn all of our solutions into projects. We used Github, a tool everyone already knows and uses for project tracking, to hold most of the information.

Each group was asked to write briefs similar to what we use for our Product projects and create implementation plans on how we would approach it. Lastly, owners were assigned to each step of their plans and we track progress similar to how we track progress with other projects in the company.

## Final Thoughts

One big thing which was identified though, through this process, was that our Designers felt guilty for working on these sorts of projects instead of their “work.” While we consider this part of their work too, once they're in the weeds it feels a lot different.

As a leadership team, we’d our individual Designer workloads to be at 80% capacity. As a result of this, I myself have resourced a good chunk of my next few weeks (and weeks since then) to increasing recruiting efforts in order to achieve the balance we want to see for our team. 

We are still working through this together and expect to follow up soon on our results through another retrospective to keep us all accountable for making the team better. I'm incredibly excited for the future of this team.
