title: The Path
---
My brother's computer was the first computer I got to use. At the time, video games were rudimentary but oh, so solid. When I inherited his old computer, the colours of Commander Keen burned my retinas neon as I clocked in the hours perfecting the perfect pogo jump. 

At some point I was introduced to AsianAvenue, Neopets, Photoshop, interest-specific chat rooms and forums on Ezboard. That was the hook point and I was married to the internet from then on. From there I started making my first websites: my profile on AA as well as my first geocities website proudly declaring my favourite things.

As I went through high school, I had convinced myself I wanted to go into computer animation. After going through a preliminary portfolio course with past professors of an animation school, I realized that I had no interest in drawing other people's creations. At the time, I couldn't see a way out of this. So, I enrolled in Graphic Design instead because frankly, what else was I going to do? At 19, I was released into the world with a diploma, some websites I had created, a useless ability to draw Bart Simpson and Ren & Stimpy from memory, and a vague sense of direction. 

My first job was found through my hobby at the time: photography. I rented a photo studio and convinced the owner that he needed me as an assistant. This would start my life-long career working for entrepreneurs. I love them. They're a special breed of people.

I helped him with his websites, some of his rental clients and whatever else he needed. It was a part-time position and I spent the rest of my spare time with my camera shooting for local bands and developing a better understanding of the commercial fashion industry in Toronto. I got to meet some really cool people but it wasn't a career so I jumped on craigslist and found a job with another entrepreneur who was looking for additional help with her growing freelance business. 

After about a year of working there, I got an itch to try something substantial so I wrote a business plan and opened up a community photography rental space. I worked full-time at the branding agency and full-time at my rental studio. I hustled for clients, built a booking system online, and learned basic marketing to get my business off the ground. Within a month I had a steady stream of clients and workshops running. That year was a blur. I was working 60-80 hours a week but it never felt like a sacrifice. 

After surveying my year, I closed the studio to focus on my design work and did another year at the branding studio. These three years at Option B and my studio were three of the most influential years of my career. I learned how to work with clients, how to set and work under deadlines, how to manage someone (didn't do that well), and how to build responsive websites. We launched some of the first responsive websites in Canada at a time when the agencies around us were still catching up.

Then I quit. I went to Barcelona for three weeks and ate ham and cheese croissants every morning and just walked around. I wanted to work in product but there were not that many product shops in Toronto at the time and I had a portfolio of agency product work. I interviewed for a few companies in San Francisco but no one took the bait. In my third week in Barcelona, I was offered a position at a start-up in Toronto. 

I hated the start-up; the working culture was terrible and I knew I couldn't stay long. Three months in, someone found me on Twitter and we had a long conversation about my shitty job over lots of cocktails.

Three months from then, I had had enough, quit my job and emailed a recruiter and Verne telling them I needed a new home. Four job offers in two weeks came and I chose JetCooper. Six months later, Satish and Verne pulled us all into ping pong room and told us we had been acquired by Shopify.

I have been asked quite a few times, "How do you get into product design?" I think they ask because they're looking for a magic answer or for me to say something that would give them some direction. I am telling my story because I want to highlight that it's not linear. I made my opportunities and I did what I could.

I'm a gut-follower. When I like something, I do it again. If I don't like it, I quit. This has guided nearly all of my decisions whether they've been career-related or personal ones. I could use this to explain away my career, but I won't.

The truth is, my career has been as deliberate as it's been undeliberate. A career is something you see looking backwards and if you point me to someone that had planned out their entire career at the start of the trail, I probably would not want to follow in their footsteps anyway. It's just not any fun knowing what's around the corner and you shouldn't be chasing certainty. 

Regardless of what path you choose, you'll learn and it'll feel like you chose that path. But, even so, you probably wouldn't even fully believe that you chose it. Robert Frost, in one of my favourite poems, so succinctly captures this feeling with the singular word, "sigh" in the following prose:

<blockquote class="large">
	<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh
	<br>Somewhere ages and ages hence:
	<br>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
	<br>I took the one less traveled by,
	<br>And that has made all the difference.</p>
</blockquote>

Chase growth.
