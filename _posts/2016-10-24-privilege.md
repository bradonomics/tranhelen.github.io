Roughly 34 years ago, my parents got on a boat to escape Vietnam’s bomb-riddled fields (my mother’s recounting of her classmates coming to school without limbs is nothing short of horrifying) and ended up in a camp in the Philippines. While there my mother gave birth to my brother and lost almost all her teeth in the pregnancy from lack of nutrition. They raised him on rice milk boiled from their rations.

After about a year, some countries granted their group of refugees the option to immigrate to build lives elsewhere. Australia took the majority of my extended family (my mother’s parents and her eight siblings) but reached their quota before my parents arrived. This left my parents and my brother with only one option: move to Canada without their extended network. My parents found a sponsorship through a priest at a Roman Catholic church in Toronto named Father Day. When they arrived they had nothing to their name.

They were lucky to find a community in Canada that was supportive and when I was born five years later, I enjoyed a generally happy environment despite lacking *privilege*. My childhood was not that plentiful, I was teased for my dress, and it was hard for me to make friends. My parents had to work blue-collar jobs, didn't see me much, and likely did demeaning or embarassing things to get to where we are now.

Nowadays, I live a stress-free life. This is a stark contrast from what I experienced growing up. When I speak to others in tech about the word *privilege*, the immediate response tends to be defensiveness, "*But I've worked hard for what I have.*"

Having the privileges I enjoy now doesn't erase my past or accomplishments. At 14, I got my first job to lessen the financial burden I had on my parents. I’ve held a full-time job (or even multiple) since the age of 19. I pooled together what I had, started a business, and made it profitable. At 24, I was able to afford my condo’s deposit on my own. All of these things still happened.

When people say the word *privilege*, it’s not a dismissal of what you have earned. *Privilege* is simply an acknowledgement that the playing field is *not even*. This is what levelling the playing field means for the underprivileged:

Our family depended on a church community to provide clothing for my brother and I; to help my parents sort through legalities; to help them obtain their Canadian citizenships; to provide emotional support with a peer network; to point them towards resources that they didn’t know existed; and to provide community events for us so we didn’t grow up alone.

Our family also depended on our neighbours; to put me through swimming class and camps in exchange for me tutoring for their daughter; to provide me with role models when my parents were too busy; to babysit me and give my mother a break; to teach me how to ride a bike; to provide free after-school activities; and to give me insight into a world that wasn’t made for me.

It wasn’t even but it was a *more even*. It has nothing to do with saying that you don't *deserve* your position in life. Your past and accomplishments still belong to you.

To solve a problem, *you must acknowledge it exists*. This means that sometimes we have to say things that confront harsh realities. But if we just sat in that discomfort a little longer we could begin to foster the types of conversations that lead towards a solution.

It’s the privilege of the privileged to lift others up.
