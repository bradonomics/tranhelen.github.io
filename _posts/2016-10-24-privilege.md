It’s hard these days to not think about *privilege*. For an industry which prides itself on its innovative thinking, it’s in the dark ages when it comes to issues about people. This is quite absurd, as self-proclaimed world-changers, because changing the world mostly means addressing people issues. The automatic reaction when approached with this issue is defensiveness. ”This environment does not have privilege,” is something I’ve heard a few times, as well as, ”I’ve worked hard for what I have.” This is my relationship with the word privilege.

<hr class="small">

To tell this story, I start with my parents’ story. My experience of privilege is forever intertwined with theirs. My last name Tran, which I typically go by first on the internet, is usually the first hint of the type of story I have.

Roughly 34ish years ago, my parents and my uncle got on a boat to escape Vietnam’s bomb-riddled fields (my mother’s recounting of her classmates coming to school without limbs is nothing short of horrifying) and ended up being saved from the seas to be put in a camp in the Philippines. While there, my mother gave birth to my brother and she lost almost all her teeth in the pregnancy from lack of nutrition. They raised him on rice milk which was boiled from their rations.

After about a year, some countries granted their group of refugees the option to immigrate to build lives elsewhere. Australia took the majority of my extended family previously (my mother’s parents and her eight siblings) but reached their quota before my parents put in their application. This left my parents, my brother, and my uncle, with only one option: move to Canada without their extended network. My parents found a sponsorship through a priest at a Roman Catholic church in Toronto named Father Day. When they arrived they had nothing to their name.

Suffice it to say, they had very little privilege. Even so, they still had more than the people they left behind in Vietnam. They were privileged to find a community in Canada that was supportive and when I was born five years later, I enjoyed a generally happy environment. I have benefitted greatly from their lives. These are my privileges:

- My parents were able to provide a cheap, but paid-for, education for me. I never worried about student debt.
- My parents are still in relatively good health for their age and I don’t have to worry (knock on wood) about them.
- I have what I call reasonable debt (a mortgage) at a very low interest rate in a city with ever-rising real estate prices. I’ve never had any other type of debt ever.
- I don’t actually even have to pay that mortgage anyway because the apartment was too big for me to begin with so I rent out my secondary bedroom.
- I can afford to take care of my needs, some of my parents’ needs, and have a little bit leftover for what we call discretionary spending. I spend it on travelling, which is the ultimate privilege.
- While I am a woman, and that puts me at a disadvantage, being an asian woman, is actually more of a norm in tech.
- Being an asian woman also affords me the luxury of invisibility. We are essentially invisible to the media, in political discourse, and sometimes, in real life. While this is a challenge in certain respects, flying under the radar when I need to can be very helpful.
- I have a job which gives me perks like cleaning services, free lunches, white guy hobby objects to play with, and the occasional trip to somewhere exotic to learn something new. It’s like perpetual college. I don’t live a very stressful life.

This is a stark contrast from what my parents experienced or even what I experienced growing up. Having these privileges now doesn’t mean that my parents didn’t have to learn English, work blue-collar jobs, deal with racist neighbours, or do demeaning things. It doesn’t erase their past.

Neither does it erase my past or accomplishments. My childhood was not that plentiful, I was teased for my dress, and it was hard for me to make friends. At 14, I got my first job to lessen the financial burden I had on my parents. I’ve held a full-time job (or even multiple) since the age of 19. I pooled together what I had and started a business and made it out profitable. At 24, I was able to pay for my condo’s deposit. All of these things still happened.

When people say the word privilege, it’s not an attack or a dismissal of what you have earned. None of the privileges my parents and I enjoy now erase the past. That’s not what that conversation is meant to do. When people say the word privilege, it is simply an acknowledgement that the playing field is not even. This is what levelling the playing field means for the underprivileged:

Our family depended on a church community to provide clothing for my brother and I; to help my parents sort through legalities; to help them obtain their Canadian citizenships; to provide emotional support with a peer network; to point them towards resources that they didn’t know existed; and to provide community events for us so we didn’t grow up alone.

Our family also depended on our neighbours; to put me through swimming class and camps in exchange for me tutoring for their daughter; to provide me with role models when my parents were too busy; to babysit me and give my mother a break; to teach me how to ride a bike; to provide free after-school activities; and to give me insight into a world that wasn’t made for me.

It wasn’t an even field, but it was a more even field. It has nothing to do with erasing anyone’s achievements. Privilege is not a personal attack.

As poor as we were, my parents worked extra hours to send money back home to Vietnam. My grandmother and two of my Dad’s siblings were left behind and my parents held up our two families on a salary that put us in the lowest income tax bracket. When I asked my Dad why we did this, he said simply, “This is not something you decide not to do. It is our responsibility.”

To solve a problem, you must acknowledge it exists. We have to be willing and able to clarify what the context is, identify what is wrong with the situation, and explain why it’s wrong. Yes, this means that sometimes we have to say things that make us very uncomfortable because it means confronting some harsh realities that make us… well, sad.

But if we just sat in that discomfort a little longer, we could begin to foster the types of conversations that lead towards a solution. These conversations are a type of privilege too–except we should be happy to bear the burden of them. It’s the privilege of the privileged to lift others up.
