When Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Outliers, is referenced, the 10,000 hour rule (or the ten-year rule) is typically just glossed over as, “10,000 hours of practice.” This is an over-simplication of the study from which it came. The study not only involved how long people worked, but what type of work they did. One of my favourite books, So Good They Can’t Ignore You, by Cal Newport takes a closer look.
