Out of all the advice I give, I tend to give this one the most often. It's old-school advice, drilled into me when I was in college. I pass it along to all my students even now because I believe it's just as relevant now to our industry. 

<blockquote class="large">
	<p>Always keep an updated portfolio.</p>
</blockquote>

Even if you're not looking for a job or if you're happy with your company, you should always have an updated portfolio, somewhere. There are a couple of other benefits as well:

- It's another opportunity to practice
- It gives you a good sense of progress throughout your career
- It helps other Designers looking to get into an industry by providing examples of what you do day-to-day
- It helps other disciplines who are interested in our field learn more about our craft and language, something we should welcome

For the past four years though, I never followed my own advice. I had a writing portfolio but let my  portfolio languish. In the end, I found it difficult to describe my projects a year or two out from launch. While I remember the broad strokes, I simply forgot most of the details.

Most of the production work was gone because product iterations overwrite. Even my process work had been thrown away, misplaced, or left behind. While I was able to dig up some mock-ups, it wasn't the same and it was incredibly tedious to remake it and ensure that it was exactly what launched.

I generally try to lead by example. So, here it is again:

## Goals

The main reason behind this redesign was to add the case studies onto my website. While I'm not necessarily in job-hunting mode, I wanted to feel "finished" with my last position. In addition, I had a sneaking suspicion that the content was overgrowing the last design and I needed to make room for more writing in the future.

The frequent redesigns have been accommodating for doubling content every year:

As I ready myself to write more for <a href="/mailinglist.html">my mailing list</a>, I'll need a flexible template moving forward. As you can probably tell, I'm more of an <a href="/payingattention">incrementalist than I am a completionist</a>.

## Process & Style Decisions

I see no point starting a website if you don't have any content so I started by writing the case studies, collecting assets, and re-shooting my portrait.


<div class="grid">
	<div class="grid__item three--three-fifths">
		<figure><img src="/img/post/86-portrait.jpg" alt="My initial potrait shot"></figure>
	</div>
	<div class="grid__item three--two-fifths">
		<figure><img src="/img/post/86-portraitgif.gif" alt="My first video portrait"></figure>
	</div>
</div>

In the end, after sitting on the pictures a bit I wasn't too satisfied with what I had. I went back to my soul place, the desert, and asked my friend Jeremiah Warren to meet me there. He shot the new video and portrait for me with me on retouching and editing. 

Visual design is a series of decisions made one after another to craft a persona. A lot of these decisions were made in previous iterations of my website that I continue forward so I don't always have to start over. After doing some sketches on paper (there's no sense taking a picture of these because they're scribbles to most people), I started laying things out:

<div class="grid">
	<div class="grid__item three--one-half">
		<figure><img src="/img/post/86-firstiteration.jpg" class="first iteration of the main pages"></figure>
	</div>
	<div class="grid__item three--one-half">
		<figure><img src="/img/post/86-firstiteration2.jpg" class="second iteration of the pages"></figure>
	</div>
</div>

At this point, I didn't particularly enjoy the direction I was going in so I went back to zero. Dumped everything and started over pushing myself to play a bit more with depth, reduce the colour complexity, and increase the spacing.

## Style Guide & Development

<figure class="left two-fifths three--one-fifth">
	<a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/3914162-V9-0-Style-Guide" class="wimage"><img src="https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/144905/screenshots/3914162/helen9-styleguide.jpg"></a>
</figure>

Before I jump into code, I put together a brief style guide so I can ensure that I'm not introducing any snowflake elements without reason. I went back and forth between the style guide and my mock-ups to ensure I'm more or less following the rules but <em>I don't break my back.</em> There are diminishing returns if I try to be pixel-perfect with a mock-up made for myself.

I built this website using HTML + SCSS using Jekyll and Github pages all of which I've made available on it's Github repo<a id="anchor-1" href="#note-1" class="fieldnotes-anchor">[1]</a> for reference purposes.

The only thing particularly unique for my website is that I designed on, and developed with, an 11-column grid. I tend to design with an odd number of columns. I've done this for a very long time because I generally find even-numbered grids to be stifling. I used csswizardry's grid<a id="anchor-2" href="#note-2" class="fieldnotes-anchor">[2]</a> to start with and adjusted it to accommodate.

## Launch

The complete project cost me about 120 hours from start to finish inclusive of the writing I did (minus the photoshoot). I still have a few things to work on (accessibility & performance review, better sharing images for Twitter, etc.) but I'll work on them as I go.

Seriously though,
