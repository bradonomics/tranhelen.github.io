## Description
__Programs:__ AE & Photoshop  
__Time spent:__ Five hours  
__Working files:__ [Download on Dribbble](https://drb.li/JBanT)

Basic animation to practice multiple masking and using null objects to position multiple layers over a prolonged timeframe. Animation ends rather abruptly but didn't want to spend much more time on it.

## Takeaways
* I spent a lot of time fixing Keyframes in my pre-comps because I decided after I was done that I wanted different timing. Note to future me to figure out the layers/timing before pre-composing.
* Outer glow looks really shitty when compressed down to a GIF. Had to redo the process a couple of times in order to learn this, may forego doing anything like this in the future if intending to publish it anywhere.
* Have a firm grasp of keyframes + basic animation now, ready to try other things. Pegging the circular completion graphic for better animation in the future and this one probably could have used a drag motion to indicate the user scrolling the content upwards.
