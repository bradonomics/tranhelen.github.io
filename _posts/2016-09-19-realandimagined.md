The light shining into the room outlined a silhouette of the familiar short-*ish* man. He faced away from me looking out towards the city with his arms clasped behind his back. I was sitting at a long boardroom table, behind him, at a seat far enough to imply confusion but close enough to not be rude. I was told to come here, instead of our office, into a tall glossy building which reeked of excessive wealth. It was nice to be served fizzy water but I don’t think I appreciate fizzy water as much as the rich do. Fizzy water is wasted on me.

He started, “You see the world like I do.” *I do?* “You see the world… without boundaries.” *Oh, geez.*<a id="anchor-1" href="#note-1">&#42;</a>

The half hour conversation was exactly what he had pictured but it was not going as I had planned. I was there to pitch my idea for a new design system. He was there to mentor me. I wasn’t sure what went wrong during the initial meeting arrangement that landed me in this situation but I knew better than to correct the course of events. Sometimes people just need to be heard.

There are imagined boundaries and real boundaries.

Imagined boundaries exist by default. They are created by the people around you but they are typically a shared delusion. Imagined boundaries are: *I feel obligated to see her and so I must* or *I cannot quit because I need to find another job first*. You can live through breaking these boundaries but it might be uncomfortable. They force you to rely on your resourcefulness to find a way out. Most people won’t break them and they get <a href="http://helentran.com/his-greatest-gift">Default Life</a>.

Real boundaries don’t exist unless you make them. These boundaries are the only ones worth following&mdash;rules you set so you can live according to your values and obtain the future you imagine yourself living. It takes a grand amount of self-work to define your values, and even more to define your boundaries.

Defining boundaries gives you true freedom. The ability to look into a room and act without social anxiety because you know who you are. The ability to carve a career for yourself based on your strengths rather than what fills the role. The ability to feel peace because you’ve found a purpose for your life and you won’t accept anything less than perfect.

I don’t think we think about our boundaries enough. We get so caught up in other people’s imagined boundaries that we don’t take enough time to pause and think–*is this what I really want?*

Setting up boundaries been the most freeing thing I’ve ever done. I set more as I get older and find what really works for me. I will no longer do things that do not grow me or make me happy. This has unblocked my creativity and allowed me to live productive and stress-free.

The silhouette was only half right. No boundaries means no freedom.
