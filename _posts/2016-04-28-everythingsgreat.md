title: Everything's Great

"The Big Short" was a film released last year covering the collapse of the housing market and unearthing the apathy behind some of the most fraudulent loans ever created. The movie (perhaps excessively) makes mention of optimism and cynicism as driving forces behind the main actions of the characters. It's hard to criticize it for making this claim, as we know from the aftermath of the collapse that there were many obvious signs of a collapsing market but nobody pointed it out because it seemed like *everything was going to be okay.*

It's hard not to note that this type of attitude is present in nearly every aspect of life. We're constantly told to *be optimists!* and see the sunnier side of things. It's now an industry making millions (hint: it's a scam) built on a foundation of smiles and good feelings. This commercial push is furthered enhanced by our increased usage of curated social media. As social creatures we can't help but compare ourselves to each other.

Not only does this impact our ability to recognize fragile systems when they exist however it's been noted to also be detrimental to our mental health. The optimism bubble creates an impossible environment to admit when something has actually gone wrong. This pop-based psychology backfires and causes resentment and isolation, "*Why aren't I happy? What is wrong with me?*" 

And despite "The Big Short" being an exceptionally well-made movie (editorializing here), it's guilty of doing the exact same thing in the *reverse* manner. Mark Baum and his clan of cynicism bandits are angry because being angry and being cynical are the same thing.<a id="anchor-1" href="#note-1">*</a>

Now what if we moved away from the viewpoint words of *optimism* and *cynicism* and looked instead at their emotional equivalents? What we're actually talking about here is *happiness* and *sadness* which are two emotions that are equally as uplifted and demonized.

I'd hesitate to say that the goal of finding happiness is less worthy of an experience than the journey through sadness although it's hard to argue that sadness isn't more compelling.

Marc Maron's podcast originally started with mini-rants which he called "what the fuck" moments. You could hate his delivery, however, his podcast has been received with universal acclaim as his attitude and his interviews have made for the most compelling content on the platform. Why? Because it's balanced. Because complexity is interesting. Because only being happy or optimistic is not human.

These two viewpoints that we have decided that we have to choose from affects our ability to critically think our way through a situation. This is usually mistakenly attributed to being too emotional (too angry, too happy, too sad, etc) but the actual problem is that we're ignoring that we need a balance in order to properly solve a problem.

I've been noticing that this comes up time and time again as I sort my way through the beginning stages of learning how to manage humans. Choosing to only view the world in one way alienates an entire swath of people who can add value to your team if you gave them some breathing room.

You have to be willing to admit that there's a problem to begin with and remove your head from the sand. It's okay to tell someone that things suck right now or listen to them tell you what's wrong. Grieve that you don't have a perfect situation and enjoy laughing about it.

And when you're done, you both can put your heads down and figure out how to fix it.
