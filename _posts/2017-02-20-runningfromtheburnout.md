Five years ago I burned out spectacularly. Since then I've guarded my life aggressively to ensure it never happens again. Burnout interfered with my life, taking over and emotionally consuming what was happening at work.

I've rebuilt a lot of my life since then. These are the things that have helped:

**Exercise and meditation**  
I cannot stress how important this is. These two activities have changed my life dramatically. I have reserves of energy, can focus my attention deliberately, and eliminated all physical pains and aches. After the first couple of months of regular activity, your body will start to crave exercise, and it becomes easier and easier to stick to.

**Create some boundaries**  
I haven't installed work-related apps on my phone nor do I have access to my e-mail. All work-related notifications are turned off. This ensures my attention is 100% on my personal life when I'm not at work. I leave my phone and other electronic devices outside of my bedroom while I sleep.

I also don't have lunch meetings, work from home once a week, and never attend more than _one_ networking event per month. These last three rules are to protect my introversion and maintain a steady mood.

**Write down your priorities**  
At the start of every quarter, I decide on three priorities or projects that I want to deliver on at work. I use these as my work _values_ and use this to prioritize any requests at work. I aggressively say no to things that are far outside of these priorities. You can't get anything done if you're trying to be everything to everyone.

**Schedule incubation time**  
Blocks of time in my calendar are scheduled for thought incubation time. When you're busy reacting all the time, you stress yourself out unnecessarily. Make time to escape mentally and let your thoughts rest. You'll find yourself being more creative and less stressed.

**Create feedback loops**  
Lack of progress, or a feeling of lack of progress, can be one of the leading factors to burnout. When a project never feels _finished_, despair can set in pretty easily. Structuring frequent feedback loops is a great motivator and can help encourage more positive thoughts. Set tiny and daily actions (work-related or not) that you know you _can_ achieve.

**Talk to someone**  
Find someone inside work who can be your peer support for your harder days. They need not be overly positive nor negative, but rather, an active listener. If either extremes are happening within this relationship, find someone else.

**Do something else**  
Hiking was the last step in ensuring my long-term mental health. Finding something else outside of my job which I look forward to helps give me perspective on the smaller difficulties and keeps me feeling positive.

Preventive measures are the best solution for burnout but don't forget that it's also _not all your fault_. Tech does not have the best reputation for quality work cultures and management could also fail you in this regard. Stay diligent and protect yourself.
