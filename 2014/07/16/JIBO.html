<p>This year marks the thirteenth year of my partnership with technology. I have dedicated my career and until recently, most of my free-time in technology-related pursuits. This year also happens to be the first year in which I have felt truly disconnected from the person that I had related to for the majority of my life.</p>

<p>Working and living with technology affords you lots of opportunities to live a great life. As I run into the bigger problems, however, I’m noticing that the solutions aren’t found in technology. The most soul-burning question I have at the top of my mind right now is, “What is all of this, really?” and that answer cannot be found in the face of an iPhone, humanistic robots or data-mining social media websites. What I’m looking for is found in other people, except that other people no longer appear to be as interested or involved in creating connections as they once were.</p>

<p>In Sherry Tuckle’s TED talk, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_alone_together">Connected but alone?</a>, she observes that the way we are looking at relationships is changing. People want to connect but only if the connection can be had at a distance, in amounts they can control. This need to control how we are perceived to others highlights an insecurity we have to not be faulty. In the digital age, you can be whoever you want to be.</p>

<p>This purposeful distancing also makes us more prone to feeling alone. How we feel <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0069841">when using Facebook</a>, working in <a href="http://devpressed.com/">competitive online industries</a> and when using the <a href="http://psychcentral.com/news/2012/05/22/depression-linked-with-more-internet-use/38998.html">internet in general</a> is affecting our relationships and mental health. Is this the connected life?</p>

<p>The latest social robot, JIBO, promises more than just individual companionship and basic administrative role-playing, it’s promises companionship to an entire family. In MIT Professor Cynthia Breazeal’s video pledge to crowd-fund JIBO, she rallies potential supporters,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>…we need your help; to build JIBO; to bring it to the world and to grow the community. Let’s work together to make JIBO truly great. And together, we can humanize technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tuckle’s talk is focused on about exactly this. We are seeking relationships with machines that are designed to be humanistic instead of looking to each other for these connections. These machines are programmed by someone to nod their heads or beep deeply in a effort to mimic human empathy. Do we want empathy or do we want mimicked empathy?</p>

<hr class="seperator small" />

<p>As a result of the flurry of social apps we have created, we have become unable to sit by ourselves without filling the empty moments with other people’s lives. This addiction doesn’t come out of a desire to deepen connection and occasionally comes at the expense of the actual person in front of us. We have confused solitude with isolation and as a result, could potentially be leaving ourselves with only one: isolation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we don’t teach our children to be alone,
they will only know how to be lonely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I don’t believe that exploring the idea of something like JIBO is not worthwhile, Breazeal paints a world in which technology is <em>more</em> than just a tool. Technology needn’t be that romanticized—it’s impacts are obvious and profound.Technology is a tool and I hope we always question the importance of the role it plays in our lives.</p>
