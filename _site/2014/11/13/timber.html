		<p>The first team I was placed on at Shopify was the Themes team. The mandate of this team is to make it easier for Theme Developers to work with Shopify as well as maintain a group of free themes that can serve our customer base.</p>

		<p>In the process of learning how to build my first theme I found out through experience that it was not quite as easy as it should be. Another designer was onboarded at the same time as I was and after a few months it became clear what the biggest pain points were.</p>

		<p>After I finished my first theme, I was looking for a new project to sink my teeth into. I had just spent some time creating a theme requirements document with the Themes team but I knew we could do better. I thought a boilerplate was the perfect way to get across requirements while teaching people the simplest way to build a Shopify theme. Unbeknownst to me, the developer I was working with for Lookbook was also thinking about solving these problems.</p>

		<p>Fast forward a couple of weeks later, [Carson Shold](https://twitter.com/cshold) and I were in the midst of forming the foundations for Timber.</p>

		<h2>Our Experience</h2>

		<p>When first learning to build a new Shopify theme, you find out that there is a list of requirements that must be satisfied before it is published. Each theme goes through multiple checkpoints with the Shopify theme gurus and in order to be accepted into the Theme Store you have to satisify all requirements.</p>

<div class="grid grid--full">
	<div class="grid__item push--one--two-twelfths one--eight-twelfths">

		<p>Theme requirements could range from obvious asks like displaying products on a collection page or technical work like including Google rich snippets. This list of requirements had to be compiled by piecing apart other themes, checking off two differing lists of requirements from Shopify's docs, following <a href="http://www.tetchi.ca/shopify-theme-from-scratch/">Tetsuro's theme tutorial</a>, or through osmosis. Not ideal.</p>

		<h2>Further Research</h2>

		<p>We lined up some interviews with some fresh and veteran theme developers and spoke to them about the Shopify development process. From their interviews we learned:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>After their first themes, people built boilerplates to work from and to build faster.</li>
			<li>Knowledge of our currently available resources (like <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/skeleton-theme">Skeleton</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme">our Theme Gem</a> was low.</li>
			<li>They relied on forums, <a href="http://cheat.markdunkley.com/">Mark Dunkley's cheat sheet</a> or Google to learn liquid.</li>
			<li>A grid system was considered a valuable add, as it would jumpstart development quickly and would remove the onus on the developers to incorporate their own.</li>
			<li>All disciplines were involved in building, not just developers.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Project Objectives</h2>

		<p>From our experiences and our further research we formed the initial product requirements/strategy:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The framework/boilerplate had to target more than just developers. Theme designers are a varied bunch. A github repo with a README did not and would not work.</li>
			<li>The boilerplate had to include everything you needed to include to pass the Shopify theme gurus' testing.</li>
			<li>It had to include all the liquid tags you need to create just about every type of store you wanted.</li>
			<li>The theme had to educate you while not being intrusive or irritating. It had to be well-commented so you would never have to ask what a liquid tag or template did.</li>
			<li>The grid system had to be light, easy-to-use and easy-to-learn.</li>
			<li>It should not define any styles beyond what is absolutely necessary.</li>
			<li>It had to be small and light-weight. We had no desires to create something like Bootstrap.</li>
			<li>It had to be well-documented.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Branding</h2>

		<p>During some initial exploration about building concepts, I became enamoured with the word "Timber." I pitched the idea to Carson and shortly after we planned a meeting with the Themes team to hear their ideas for what we should name it.</p>

		<p>After an hour-long brain-dump firestorm with the Themes team and a lightning round of old-fashioned democracy, we settled on the name Timber.</p>

		<p>Timber is a husky word. When you think Timber, wood grains, planks, and trees come to mind. If you are Canadian or a beaver enthusiast, you most likely also have a lumberjack somewhere in your thoughts. This leads to some pretty kitschy ideas but literal representations of Timber was not exactly what I was looking for.</p>

		<p>In my inital explorations of the word Timber I had come across architectural drawings of gable roofs. These lines were then incorporated into Timber's header graphics and I developed the colour scheme from colour-dropping different types of wood.</p>

<h2>Iteratng on Timber</h2>

<div class="grid grid--full">
	<div class="grid__item push--one--two-twelfths one--eight-twelfths">

		<p>From our experiences, we decided the best grid framework to incorporate was <a href="https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry-grids">CSS Wizardry's grids</a>. It had the right balance of flexibility, ease of learning and Harry Roberts has done a great job of documenting it.</p>

		<p>From there, we split responsibilities: I focused on designing the documentation while he worked on the development of Timber.</p>

		<p>The inital round of documentation was a lot shorter than it is right now. My first kick at the design was released but it later proved to be difficult to read (by myself, even) and the content outgrew the design system very quickly.

		<p>In the second iteration of Timber's documentation, readability was my first goal. I dimmed the colour palette, simplified the heading system and massaged the content so it was quicker and easier to read.</p>

		<h2>Present and Future</h2>

		<p>The response to Timber has been very positive and we are seeing more and more themes being sent to the theme gurus based off of Timber. It has not only been adopted externally but also internally. Our new themes are built with Timber, we used it for our <a href="http://hardware.shopify.com">hardware store</a> and it is being incorporated into our older themes as the new standard codebase. This will allow developers to pick up any of our free themes and modify them quickly.</p>

		<p>Currently, there are plans to improve the themes <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/Timber/issues/155">development workflow</a> and provide build variations. In the meantime, developers can always rest assured that Timber is always updated with the latest theme features. No longer will anyone have to piece together a bunch of resources to build a theme!</p>
