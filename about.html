								<h2>I'm a <em>Product Designer</em> at <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a>. I'm currently managing a design team and use words like <em>scaling and holistic</em> when referring to them or our projects.</h2>

								<p>Part-time I've been mentoring students at <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> for two years but am now looking for new ways to change design education.</p>

								<p>After formal print design education, I started <a href="http://helentran.com/the-path">my career</a> working for a documentary film maker. He won some awards and I moved onto a branding agency and started a photography business. After my work was published in a few newspapers and magazines, I abruptly sold my camera and gear and quit my branding job. I bounced around some start-ups until I found <a href="http://jetcooper.com">JetCooper</a> and we all moved to <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a> about three years ago. Sometime in this, I met Martin Sheen.</p>

								<p>I make time for <a href="http://instagram.com/tranhelen">travel</a>, stalking stand-up comedians, writing, and the gym. I fantastize about having a dog but have commitment issues so I've settled for two succulents named <em>Dant√©</em> and <em>Sedona</em>. They get watered when I feel like it.</p>
