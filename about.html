								<h2>I&rsquo;m a <em>Product Designer</em>. I&rsquo;m currently managing a design team and use words like <em>scaling and holistic</em> when referring to them or our projects.</h2>

								<p>Part-time, I&rsquo;ve mentored students at <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> for the past two years but am now looking for new ways to change design education.</p>

								<p>I started <a href="http://helentran.com/the-path">my career</a> working for a documentary film maker. He won some awards and I met Martin Sheen. I moved onto a branding agency and started a photography business. After my work was published in a few newspapers and magazines, I sold my camera and equipment and quit my branding job. I passed through a start-up until I found <a href="http://jetcooper.com">Jet Cooper</a>. It was acquired about 3.5 years ago by another company.</p>

								<p>I make time for <a href="http://instagram.com/tranhelen">travel</a>, stalking stand-up comedians, writing, and the gym. I live with two succulents named Dante and Sedona and my dog Dante. I try not to tell him he has the same name as his roommate <em>the succulent</em>.</p>
