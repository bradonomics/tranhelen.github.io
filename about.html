		<h5>This picture is very serious</h5>
		<h1 class="one-line">Hello!</h1>

		<h2>I'm a <em>Product Designer</em> at <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a>. I'm currently managing a design team and use words like <em>scaling and holistic</em> when referring to them or our projects.</h2>

		<p>Part-time I've been mentoring students at <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> for the past two years but am now looking for new ways to change design education.</p>

		<p>I was brought to <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a> three years ago when it acquired the User Experience angecy I was working at named <a href="http://jetcooper.com">JetCooper</a>. Before that, I worked for a couple of start-ups after a long stint at a branding agency and a brief stint working for a documentary film maker. I met Martin Sheen once. Somewhere along the journey I ran a photography studio and had my work published in a few magazines and newspapers.</p>

		<p>I have a background in formal print design education and have been creating websites for the better part of 15 years. I'm internet OG. Despite this, I've never had my design work featured anywhere. I can imagine that's a good feeling though.</p>

		<p>Outside of work, I make time for <a href="http://instagram.com/tranhelen">travel</a>, stalking stand-up comedians, writing, and the gym. I fantastize about having a dog but have commitment issues so I've settled for two succulents named <em>Dant√©</em> and <em>Sedona</em>, respectively. They get watered when I feel like it.</p>
