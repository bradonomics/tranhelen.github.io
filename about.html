								<h2>I&rsquo;m a Designer currently working as a <em>Design Lead</em> at <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a>. I work on growing our design practice and building an <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/blog/17954592-introducing-multichannel-shopify">application platform</a>.</h2>

								<p>I was* an entrepreneur and have been working for/with entrepreneurs for my whole life. I like the movement of money and this motivates me to build tools to lead people to financial independence.</p>

								<p>Aside from making money move, I enjoy spending time on the next generation of designers. I mentored students at <a href="http://bloc.io">Bloc</a> for two years and now <a href="https://www.outofofficehours.com/">make myself available</a> for newcomers to the industry.</p>

								<p>I believe Design is a wonderful viewpoint from which to see the world. I teach, mentor, speak, and write, all in an effort to make this viewpoint accessible to everyone at all levels and disciplines.</p>

								<p>In my spare time, I <a href="http://instagram.com/tranhelen">travel</a>, stalk stand-up comedians, and spend time at the gym. Two succulents (Dante and Sedona) and some human friends are involved in my life as well. Both groups are very nice to me.</p>

								<p>* Can this be used in past tense?</p>

								<h2>Appearances</h2>

								<p><a href="http://twitter.com/tranhelen">DM me</a> if you want me around. I prefer panels, workshops, and podcast formats. No, I don't want to talk or write specifically about being a woman in tech.</p>
