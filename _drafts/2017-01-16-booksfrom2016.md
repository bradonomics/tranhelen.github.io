        <p>Last year I re-ignited my love for reading. This is this year's round-up on what passed through my proverbial bookshelf.</p>

        <p>This time around I'm highlighting the books that have <em>changed my perspective</em> and some <em>honourable mentions</em>. The rest I've lumped into other types of categories.</p>

        <hr class="small">

        <h2 class="one--text-center">The Highlights</h2>

                <p><b>Consider the Lobster, David Foster Wallace</b>
                <br>Another collection of essays by DFW, a couple of which changed the way I look at the presidential campaign in 2016 prior to the election results, the English dictionary and how <em>white male standard English</em> affects minorities, and autobiographies written by stars.</p>

                <p><b>But What If We're Wrong?, Chuck Klosterman</b>
                <br>If gravity, something the author believes to be true to the deepest levels of his being, is <em>incorrect</em>, what does that mean?</p>
                <p>This book meandered a bit but the overall argument was interesting. I'm now dedicating more time to proving myself wrongâ€“it changed the way I think.</p>

                <p><b>Consolations, David Whyte</b>
                <br>I happened by this book accidentally through a very emotional time and it was the first time I had ever found a poet who I made my heart <em>move</em>. There are two other poetry books on my reading list this year because of him.</p>

                <p><b>Listen, Liberal, Thomas Frank</b>
                <br>After the election, I went searching for some answers and a friend recommended this book to me. It explained the history of the Democratic party and I understood the  results to be more sensical than not at the end.</p>
                <p>I'll be exploring more political books (not internet articles) over the next year to develop my understanding better.</p>

                <p><b>Managing Humans, Michael Lopp</b>
                <br>This was an especially trying management year for me; scaling the team at Shopify from 4 to 18 was a challenge. I asked lots of questions and didn't find satisfaction in many of them.</p>
                <p>As a fan of Rands' writing online, I thought that reading his book was a safe bet and it certainly was the right choice. I even wrote about it.</p>

                <p><b>The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide, James Fadiman</b>
                <br>I have spent the past little bit of my life exploring alternative therapies and this book led me down a rabbit hole of learning about psychedelic drugs.</p>
                <p>I've run a microdosing experiment because of it and plan to delve deeper into the spiritual realms before deciding whether or not it's made a <em>positive</em> impact.</p>

                <p><b>Lost at Sea, Jon Ronson</b>
                <br/>I've been eating up everything written by Jon Ronson this year, and this was another excellent collection of extraordinary people doing strange things.</p>

                <p><b>So You've Been Publicly Shamed, Jon Ronson</b>

                <br>This book didn't make the above list because it wasn't <em>as</em> transformative but it was an enjoyable read about the people who we shame on the internet.</p>

                <br/>If you've ever wanted a humourous insight into the world of extremists, pick this up. It's bizarre.</p>

                <p><b>The Men Who Stare at Goats, Jon Ronson</b>

                <br>The movie was based on a true story. I never saw the movie, but uh, I'm assuming the book is a bit weirder.</p>

                <p><b>The Psychopath Test, Jon Ronson</b>
                <br/>This was my first foray into JR. You've likely realized by now that I read everything he's written in one year. I recommend his audiobooks over the written ones. His narration is supreme.</p>
