The majority of this year for me was spent focusing on becoming a better writer. I define better writing by clarity, ease of reading, and how well it represents what I'm thinking about. I have collected some rules which I'm following.

**Remove the drama.** Poorly written articles are riddled with hard paragraph breaks with dramatic sentences in lieu of a thesis. See what happens to your article if you simply deleted them.

**Clarify your introduction.** State your thesis clearly and move on. You do not need to qualify yourself, apologize for writing, or tell a metaphor.

**Ensure precision not pretentiousness.** You do not have to use a top-shelf word unless it's more efficient. Avoid marketing speak; most of the time, it's hiding what you're trying to say.

**Use these words sparingly.** That, usually, actually, really, very, like, basically, essentially, just, kind of, practically, somewhat, sort of, simply. Is she *really nice* or *kind of*? No, she's nice.

**Stop with the metaphors.** If your metaphor takes you the same amount of time to explain as your main topic, skip the metaphor. It's a technique which should be used only when the topic is complex or the piece is poetic.

**Read your work out loud.** Pay attention to how the sentences come out. Is there rhythm? Are there too many short sentences with awkward breaks? Would you ever _speak_ to anyone that way?

**Re-write your work.** If you're not spending just as much time rewriting (or more), you're being sloppy. Spend some time to re-write your work. Cut, and cut, and cut, until there are no more unnecessary words.

Rule of all rules: **do not waste your readers' time.**
