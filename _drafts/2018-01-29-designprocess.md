Inevitably every Designer gets hit with the question, "What is your Design process?"

The question, while well-intentioned, occasionally leads to either a really vague or well-rehearsed answer. This is because, mainly, design process isn't defined by the Designer themself.

When thinking about design tools (photoshop, sketch, etc.) and methodologies (design sprints, user research, etc) it's easy to parallel it to the job of a handyman. A handyman carries around a set of tools or ways of working, and depending on what they're trying to fix, they apply the appropriate tool to the situation.

In general, though, problem sovling follows a pariticlaryl regular framework:

IDEA SOMETHING EXECUTIVE WHATEVER

THis is one of the mental models sold by the google five step process. There are many and they all use generally the same words to describe each stage. See figure whatever below of the 5 step process of problem solving I found with a quite Google search online



All of things mean the same thing. This is something you can call the 'design process,' certainly, and it's an easier way to sell things to clients. However, in general, the bigger the problemâ€“the less likely you can apply a defined process like this to it.

You can do one of two things:

- You can break down the problem or product into smaller components in which you can apply this cycle to. This is one way to work through a roadmap and create chunks that are manageable to ship. This is helpful when you are wrestling with a larger team, especially, as overwhelming amount sof information is generally hard to communicate through many people without losing large parts of it somewhere along the way.

- You can apply part of a cycle like this and continously imrpove it until you are ready to move or the problem is simple enough.

# AGILE vs. WATERFALL

Both of these ways of working can impact the eventual results of a design process. In an AGILE environment, you run the risk of spinning cycles ternally and/or skipping parts of the process that shouldn't be skipped.

For example, in AGILE environments, teams tend to priotize shipping over IDEATION. This is part of the mantra of fast-shipping and breaking environments. This can be successful while your team is small and the risks of investing time are lower than if your team was much larger. At a certain size, mistakes become expensive.

THis is when orgs tend to use a waterfall process, for fear of the risk of making moves. The risks of waterfall with the design process are clear: if the stakeholders at the beginning of the process aren't there in the middle, they're not going to approve of the end.

# How do I pick which methodologies work and when do I use them

There are many tools a Designer can use and many different methodologies that can be applied to a number of different situations. As a Designer who doesn't have much experience in this or doesn't have a senior team to learn from, the best thing you can do is experiment and try out new htings one by one until you lern the nuances of each tool.

As your team grows, keep a running document somewhere that your team can reference with the notes that you've learned about each exercise. Our team at Shopify did that for a bit regarding our Design sprints. Over time, we learned which exercises worked in the Shopify context, which ones did not work for specific team make-ups. 

As our Designers bcame more experinced, they were able to switch exercises out on the spot to save wasting time on a sprint exercise that may not work.

# Is having no process OK?

If we define process as a way of getting the right things done on time, no, not really. I fyou're deifning process as anything other than that, maybe. 

Some peopel get the wrong impression that process is simply a bunch of documentation. Generally, if your process isn't saving time, it's not a good process and deserves to be looked at on it's own. You can apply iterative design process to porcess itself. (Oh, geez, meta.) 

You still always need to understand the probem, be clear about the constraints, and dliver the best (not first) solution. 

In situations where you feel the pressure to ship fast, and the response is "ship anything," be careful about those decisions. Fast decisions that aren't well thought-through can rear their ugly heads later on in the project, or even years down the line. There's a fine line between shipping fast and shipping carelessly.

# Once you've mastered it

The best thing baout Design process is that once you've mastered in in a few situations, you really can <a href="">apply it to anything</a>. Many practitioners in different design idnustries all use the same general process bceause it's applicable in problem solving in general.

Design thinking itself has been touted in bsuiness circles for this very erason: it's a great way to ensure that your decision making is sound proof. 

Good process is adesign process.
