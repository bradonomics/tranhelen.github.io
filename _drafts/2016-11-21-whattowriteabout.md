The word *opinionated* has been directed towards me often as an accusation. The issue is that apathy is the norm. It's very easy to form _no opinion_ but nothing gets done on a bed of silence. Discourse carries action.

It's not always that people have nothing to write about, it's that they haven't honed the skill of forming an opinion about what they've seen. Everyone has been gifted a unique experience but not everyone cultivates what they _think_ about it.

The best thing I learned about how to write was how to make a stance. I learned it during a Second City class focused on writing satire. You cannot write satire without forming an opinion. With these basic techniques I was able to identify easily what I *could* write about and what I *wanted* to write about.
