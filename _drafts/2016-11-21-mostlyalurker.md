It's been about a year now and at the time of writing, there are 18 Product Designers in the Shopify Toronto office, 5 of which directly report to me.

I get a little bit flustered when asked to decribe what I do because it's not written anywhere. The title of *Manager* or *Lead* is disagreed upon wildly across organizations so I always fear that I'll be judged against the _worst manager they've ever had_.

My week is filled with the following appointments:

- **Product Strategy meetings**; to understand resourcing needs, to align our Design team's goals with the business goals, to represent the Design team's interests, to ensure they are not being left out of the right conversations
- **Shit-solving meetings**; to resolve issues with them or on their behalf which pop up randomly, to talk to a person in the company about what our team is doing, to plan things we're planning, to book dinners
- **Recruiting hellos**; to meet new Designers who might be good fits for our team, to see if they're worth putting into the pipeline, to understand who they are before they show up at our door
- **Team culture events**; to help build friendships and trust-based relationships for both introverts/extroverts, to build a smaller internal community which retains Designers, to help them practice communication with diverse personalities outside of their project teams, to encourage hapless feedback sessions in the hallway
- **Weekly syncs**; 15 mins with each report to go over deliverables for the week, to understand each project's roadmap and where they are, to pinpoint communication issues before they happen, to suggest tools or Design strategies which may help them
- **Fresh eyes/Design review feedback sessions**; to help Designers practice their presentation skills with their peers, to encourage Designers to give each other feedback, to hone their critical thinking skills, to provide information about other projects that may affect their work, to provide information about other projects their work affects
- **Self-education**; to spend on personal growth, to ensure that I'm always ahead of the curve, to research new things I can bring back to the team
- **Education projects**; to plan workshops for them when I can, to bring in subject matter experts that could advance the team's overall understanding of their craft
- **Performance reviews**; to give them six-month assessments twice a year on their work, their momentum, and their growth, to solicit feedback from their peers on their behalf
- **1-on-1's**; time with my individual direct reports to ensure that they're *happy*, that everything in their world which I can affect is going well, to understand current problems, to sniff out potential future problems, to help them think about their growth and career, to offer information I hear around the company which provides context to their day-to-day lives, to offer fast feedback on their month

When all of these are done and it looks like I've done nothing at all, everything is going well.
