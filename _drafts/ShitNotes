When I meet normies out in everyday life some of them think I'm weird. Now, I can't possibly agree to this assessment, because weird is one of those judgements that can only be passed from the outside. I take no pleasure in being called weird but neither am I insulted by it because I know stuff that isn't on most people's radars and I wouldn't even call them weird (for example, I know that [this guy](http://www.conciergedumonde.com/sugar_weasel.htm) is an escort and I would simply label that as hilarious). Let's give them the benefit of the doubt though and agree that I'm weird.

There's a lot of words on the internet. There's nothing wrong with most words except that some words are being strung together in the same way, in the same type of article, and even posted to the same network. The problem I have with this is that a lot of our industry is sharing a delusion that being a product of your environment is totally okay. It's totally not fucking okay.

Someone once challenged me in the midst of a gripping session about my mom (it was a long time ago) who had promised me a trip to Australia but didn't deliver. My teenage self could not fathom how she could break such an honourable promise and I was outraged by her treacherous betrayal.

**Me**: "I want to go so badly."  
**Her**: "Then save up your own money to go."  
**Me**: "But she told me she would do that." 
**Her**: "Well, how badly do you want it?"

My rage turned it's face towards her direction as my new victim. *How dare she. What is her problem? Can't she see the actual problem here is not me?* 

This question has followed me through the years and it pops up in the most inconvienant of times. It's really easy to sit back and hope that the universe magically works itself out. In fact, if you do this, you'll probably be *okay* in some sense of the word provided you were given equal conditions to begin with. But... is that really the life you want to live?
