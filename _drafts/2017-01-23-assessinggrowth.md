As the company scales a team cannot afford to function any longer on an ad-hoc basis. What can get lost within rapid growth are your expectations of your Designers. When this happened on my own team, our leadership team clarified the expectations with a document. This gave:

1. ...us something to point to during assessments later on in the year
2. ...our reports a clearer reference on what we considered to be a great designer

Aside from laying out the basic expectations we have of all Designers on our team, it explains the rubric we use to assess our Designers.

## Profiles

Each Designer is assessed using four different frames: craft, ownership, influence, and team. We took these four, potentially interpreted as abstract, terms and explained exactly what how we expected each Designer at different impact levels to act.

### **I am an intern**

##### Craft

I work on a portion of a project and need regular assistance by another Designer or my lead.

##### Ownership

I work on one small thing at a time and ensure it is reviewed by the lead designer on the project.

##### Influence

I am focusing mostly on getting better at Design as a discipline and any decisions I make are in combination with the other Designer on the project.

##### Team

I am helping with low-hanging fruit (like icons) and I join the team activities like stand-up.

### **I am a Product Designer**

##### Craft

I can tackle a project with the guidance of my lead according to the schedule agreed upon by my team. I address issues as they arise and never block the team from moving forward.

##### Ownership

I am working on a portion or multiple portions of a project or multiple projects. I understand why I make certain decisions and how they affect my project. I am an expert on the problem.

##### Influence

The decisions I make are specific to my project and benefit my project. I am building relationships with people outside my immediate team.

##### Team

I am helping the success of the project, participating in roadmap and strategy discussions and join all team activities. I make a good example for any interns on the team.

### **I am a Senior Product Designer**

##### Craft

I can tackle a project without the guidance of my lead according to the schedule agreed upon by my team. I address issues as they arise and never block the team from moving forward.

##### Ownership

I am working on one project and am depended on to see through the project to success. The other members on my team believe I’m the person responsible for the product design decisions on the team and act accordingly. I understand why I make decisions, how they affect my project and make decisions that improve the project overall. I am an expert on this problem and can delegate tasks if necessary.

##### Influence

Although I work on this project, I also am involved or lightly involved in the support of multiple additional projects. I share these ideas and help increase the impact of the project across the company by aligning the project to the goals of R&D as defined by our VP of Product.

##### Team

Not only am I a helpful member of my team, I represent a healthy ideal of product design to the other disciplines and help grow other team members if there are others on the team.

### **I am a Product Design Lead**

##### Craft

I can tackle any project according to the schedule I defined. I am able to find and leverage the tools available and I have the skills and experience to do this well without guidance.

##### Ownership

I am ultimately responsible for the success of multiple projects.

##### Influence

I understand the context of my own team’s projects as well as the impact they have on related initiatives.  (e.g. While I lead [this project] + [this project], I also understand [the project area] as a whole.) The work that I do impacts Product Design in Toronto and Product Design at the company. I bring new ideas and approaches and foster better Design culture at Toronto and across the company.

##### Team

I am responsible for managing my team, help them grow where necessary and aligning the group’s goals to the company. I contribute to UX initiatives outside of my direct team and participate in cross-office communications.

### **I am a Senior Product Design Lead**

##### Ownership

I am ultimately responsible for the success of an area consisting of many projects.

##### Influence

I understand the context of my own team’s projects as well as the impact they have on related initiatives. (e.g. While I lead [this project] + [this project], I also understand [the project area] as a whole). I am involved in Product roadmap discussions and impact overall planning and resourcing of teams. I bring new ideas and approaches and foster better Design Culture at Toronto and across the company.

## Adjustments

While this serves as our template right now, we acknowledge that there may be room to adjust this in the future as the team grows. We are still having difficulty acknowledging the contributions of ICs (with titles) who don't decide to go into management. This framework implies that we expect all Designers to become leads but we stress that this isn't the expectation.

If you're growing a Design team, I'd love to hear<a id="anchor-1" href="#note-1" class="fieldnotes-anchor">[1]</a> what you're doing.
