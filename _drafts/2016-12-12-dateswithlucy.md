_**Disclaimer:** I'm not a doctor, which should be obvious, but just in case this disclaimer is here. I take zero responsibility for you. I suggest you do some heavy reading about this before taking anything here too seriously. I mean it, buddy._

I first heard of the term _micro-dosing_ on Reddit. I ignored it as I wasn't sure if Lucy was for me. Having spent my formative years enjoying the company of Mary Jane, I wasn't sure if I was ready to switch.

Lucy has had a recent resurgence in tech culture, being popularized by tech bro gurus, so I did some further research. An interview with Dr. James Fadiman by Tim Ferriss<a id="anchor-1" href="#note-1" class="fieldnotes-anchor">[1]</a> led me to picking up "_The Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide."_<a id="anchor-2" href="#note-2" class="fieldnotes-anchor">[2]</a> While the research is admittedly old, I was happy to consider the possibility that I was wrong. After all, the book has quotes like this in it,

> It was the greatest experience of my life.

After some fun-tertainment doses I was feeling quite pleased… I was wrong about Lucy.

Curiosity got the best of me and I planned a series of dates over the course of a month.

## Micro-dosing

_Micro-dosing_ is taking a small amount of a drug every few days. LSD comes on blotter paper and due to the illegality of it, it's hard to gauge how _much_ of the drug you're taking. To minimize irregularity, the popular suggestion is to use _volumetric dosing_.

Volumetric dosing allows you to more or less take the _same amount_ each time instead of leaving it up to chance. It's still not an exact science, but for a home DIY-er, it's the best you can do.

Micro-dosages are between 10-20ug (micrograms). A _tab_, or one _hit_, starts at 100ug and climb upwards so a micro-dose is much less than you would usually take. Fun-tertainment doses at around the 100-200ug mark. At such a low dosage (for me, 10ug) you receive none of the hallucinogenic effects which Lucy is famous for. What you get is, generally, a mood amplifier.

## The Experiment

I started in November taking it once every four days. On the second day, you're still feeling the effects. On the third day, you rest to avoid building tolerance. On the fourth day, you dose again. I stopped at the beginning of December.

This was the extent of the experiment. I was not scientific about it, I did not go in with any expectations, and I didn’t tell anyone about it until it was over.

The biggest issue I have with micro-dosing experimentations is that it seems like there’s a big of a placebo effect going on. I’m wary of anything which can be used to solve _anything_ and after reading some other accounts it looks a little bit too much like people are treating it as a panacea. 

## The Results

During the month, I was happier, more open, more productive on _some_ days, more creative on _some_ days, and friendlier overall. In general, Lucy made me more open and this has been echoed by many dosers.

The only negative side effect I noted is that it tends to make me less hungry. Since this impedes my fitness goals I stopped. In the end, micro-dosing was enjoyable but it wasn't making enough marked improvements in my life to justify continuing it.

I am biased towards choosing the sober path when I can. When it comes to fulfillment and happiness, living by [my values](http://helentran.com/carving-a-life) and working on my emotional IQ has had more permanent effects than micro-dosing. I was already on an upswing with happiness, so it's hard to tell.

I still intend to experiment with stronger doses as I am curious about the usage of LSD to explore the spiritual. Stay tuned for more dates with Lucy.
