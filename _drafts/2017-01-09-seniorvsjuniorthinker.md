Design is a long education in how to critically think about a problem. The difference between a junior and senior is rarely ever about the craft or practical skill-set; likely the easiest comparison but very rarely the right one to make when assessing effectiveness.

If we zero in on the strongest skill any Designer should have, critical thinking, the difference between "_classes_" becomes clear.

## Identification

When being described a problem, a Senior Designer will likely ask more questions than their Junior counterpart. This is to ensure that the person describing the problem is clear about the problem to begin with. Sometimes what's being described is a _symptom_ of a problem.

There's the root cause (the system's problem) and then there are the _system antics_ or the _unexpected results_ of the system which people tend to mistake for the actual problem itself.

### Common example

**Problem as described:** No one is signing up  
**Proposed solution:** The button must be bigger  
**Questions worth asking:** Is the button too small or is there a sea of distraction _around_ the button that's causing blindness? Is the copy clear? Does the button even work? Does the value proposition inspire action? Is there an interaction issue? What platform are they using?

## Constraints

Junior Designers see constraints. Senior Designers seek constraints. I wrote before in my previous post that a Designer's role is to dismantle a complex system into smaller components. A Junior Designer will look at constraints and consider them to be set in stone (unlikely, as well) and move forward based on that. A Senior Designer will seek constraints so when they break down the components of the system, it's easier to identify the problem and solve specifically for that problem.

### Common occurrences

**Problem:** We can't do this  
**Junior:** Okay, I'll create another solution  
**Senior:** Why can't we do this? What is the cause of why we can't do this? Is this engineering debt? Does this overlap with another project in the company which creates this problem? If we do this now, can we push for this later? Okay, what other constraints are there? Let's define some.

## Philosophies

Many people look at someone like Jonathan Ives and are fascinated by how well he has executed on something they call _vision._ It sounds magical... like Designers get up in the middle of the night and exclaim dramatically, "I got it." That's absurd, no.

Over time, Designers accumulate a set of beliefs (like real life!) about why they're doing certain things. This set of beliefs become their _design philosophy_ and when you hire a Senior Designer, you're hiring that set of beliefs. Jonathan Ives isn't doing well because he simply came up with the idea of the iPhone. Jonathan Ives is successful because he found a way to convince people to care about the same thing he cares about.

Juniors are very rarely filled with the conviction a Senior has. This also may be why some people believe Designers are _snotty._ Designers aren't snotty. They're opinionated. _Vision_ is just a fancy word for _opinion_.

## Priorities

We get plummeled all day and all night with new informationâ€“what I call, datapoints. It could be from traditional forms of _data_ but it could also be types of information that come purely from over-involved people in the company.

Juniors tend to treat all datapoints as equal, not knowing how to prioritize certain pieces over others. This leads to wasted cycles or a frozen Designer. A Senior Designer can say _no_ because they've already discerned whether or not that particular piece of information is worth the pivot.

These four things can put another Designer leagues ahead of the other, regardless of how much _work time_ they have put in. Expertise in this field is not determined by _years_, it's determined by how well someone can define the problem to begin with.
