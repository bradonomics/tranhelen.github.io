Who can predict a good idea? One chapter in "<i>Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the Needle</i>" has been on my mind lately. It compared managers and creators and how likely either person were to predict "a good idea." Turns out, neither are very good at it. 

Managers are in evaluator mindsets. They compare the new idea against old ideas to prevent against risks. The more expertise a person gains, the more they're set in how they view the world. 

> As we gain knowledge about a domain, we become prisoners of our prototypes.

Creators, on the other hand, are overconfident and rate their ideas as better than they are in reality. They're too close to their own tastes... they're _risky_, if you will.

Turns out the best evaluator of a good idea is your colleagueâ€“the person doing the same _type_ of work as you but not necessarily the same work.
