				<p>Design process can be applied to more than project deliverables. When I applied it to developing a new Intern program at Shopify, I was able to see exactly how beneficial it could be for the interns, the design team they were joining, and the company itself.</p>
				<p>As the team was growing, we added more senior designers and leads to the team. Senior Designers were becoming more difficult to find (and unnecessary, due to the differing requirements for each project) so our team started to looked into filling the hiring funnel with experience levels of all types.</p>
				<p>Aside from being more deliberate about hiring less experienced designers, I wanted to explore other things we could do better. I reconsidered the entire process: everything from hiring all the way through to final evaluations.</p>

					<p>Our design team of 25 was looking for opportunities to mentor, we wanted to better equip teams with people of varying skill-sets, and we wanted the breadth of our team's experience levels to reflect Shopify's future-focused priorities.</p>
					<p>We’d hired interns before in another office (fun fact: Shopify has five offices) but never in Toronto. After talking through some past experiences of interns and mentors, I wanted to zero in on how we could do better.</p>

					<p>Many interns are too green to function in a work environment off the bat despite strong technical skills, or the opposite, languish without proper mentorship from an experienced designer. They’re not set up for success, and as a result, both the company and the intern lose out on potential.
					<p>This was the perfect opportunity to solve those challenges and pilot a better way to work with interns across all offices (or perhaps, even, across the design industry). To start, I worked on a brief which outlined my core objectives for the program.</p>

				data-aos-easing="ease-out-quad">A quantitative metric wasn’t part of my objectives. While hiring metrics can prove success of an intern program, I didn’t want us focusing on that. Interns can be great advocates, bringing more candidates into the hiring funnel, and maybe returning years later.</p>

					<p>Every design team should be actively participating in hiring their designers. I encouraged the program’s mentors to participate in the hiring process. After all, they would be the experts on who could fit where, being the ones who are already working on those teams day-to-day.</p>
					<p>Top of mind for me was diversity due to holes I’d identified earlier in the year. As I was already heavily involved in hiring for the rest team so I was curious to see how new approaches would change the make-up of our applicant pool..</p>

					<h3>Structuring for our unique team</h3>

				<div data-aos="fade-up"
					data-aos-duration="1000"
					data-aos-easing="ease-out-quad">
					<p>It’s easy to find a ‘fit’ for a Designer matching them based on current strengths and long-term interests at Shopify as there are so many teams and projects. The problem is candidate portfolios are typically all over the place, and any placement would be, at best, a guess.</p>
					<p>I proposed that the interns cycled through their teams and mentors on three-week rotations. Each intern would spend one cycle working with a mentor and their team, and then move on to another one three weeks later, for a total of four cycles over three months.</p>
					<p>Each mentor would give the intern their own work and help them through the process by pairing. This approach was inspired by my experience working at Bloc. So much of our roles are rooted in strong craftsmanship and as a designer develops, clarifying their principles is key to their success. This hands-on approach is time intensive, but it produces big results in a short period of time.</p>
					<p>This approach had several benefits:</p>

					<li>Interns learned how varied ‘Design’ could be and weren’t pressured into making a decision about specialization prematurely</li>
					<li>Interns gained a better understanding of Shopify and how it functions</li>
					<li>The mentors developed a holistic understanding of each intern’s strengths and areas of improvement</li>
					<li>The mentors were empowered to pass their knowledge on to the next generation and learn leadership skills for their own careers</li>

					<p>The cycling presented a challenge: how do you prevent interns from feeling directionless when they’re moving from project to project? In a chaotic environment, ambiguity can be rather deadly for an intern’s general experience. To help, I was their manager being one single point of contact so it wasn’t too disjointed.</p>
					<p>Each intern was also asked to keep a journal to document their experience at the beginning of the program. I suggested a weekly journal but left the length and timing up to them.</p>
					<p>While great for me to see what was going on, writing things down helped reinforce insights, encouraged them to grow their self-awareness, and gave them an opportunity to practice an important communication skill. In retrospect, this was one of the most valuable parts of the internship.</p>
					<p>A Slack group was set up to help the mentors and give them an opportunity to discuss what was working, and send them feedback from their interns or other Shopify employees.</p>
					<p>At the end of each cycle, an evaluation form I made was sent to document each mentor’s thoughts about their intern’s performance and all the mentors gathered together after to discuss the interns’ performances and make final offers. These forms and documents served as the foundation for each of the intern’s assessments, giving them an artefact for their time here.</p>
