				<p class="h2">I'm a Product Designer spending the majority of my time growing a team at <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a> and helping to shape the future of commerce and entrepreneurship.</p>
				<p>The rest of my time I'm <a href="http://instagram.com/tranhelen">wandering</a> or planning out how I can live in the desert long-term. I walk around asking "Why?" a lot and mostly not out loud. By happenstance this has worked out very well for me.</p>
