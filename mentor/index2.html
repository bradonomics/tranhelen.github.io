						<h6>Hired Helen to build a portfolio with him</h6>
						<p>While she does have the answers for many things related to design and front-end development this wasn’t her goal. Motivating me to learn how to come to the answer was the goal. This approach helped instill intuitive characteristics that I needed to complete the next design or coding challenge.</p>
						<p>She truly cares about the success of her students. I’m happy that she pushed me to produce better work than I could have on my own during my bright beginnings. Highly recommend.</p>

						<h6>Hired Helen to HELP HER switch from print design to product design</h6>
						<p>She was an amazing mentor, guiding me through my projects and always providing clear, specific and thoughtful feedback. She has endless patience for her students and never made me feel uncomfortable about my work or asking for feedback. She taught me front-end development through pair programming and product design principles for iOS/Android and responsive web.</p>
						<p>More importantly, she taught me how to be confident about myself as a Designer and to really challenge myself to be better. I really credit her mentorship to my being able to make a career transition to Product Design. Even now when I work on client projects I think to myself, "What would Helen say about this?</p>
